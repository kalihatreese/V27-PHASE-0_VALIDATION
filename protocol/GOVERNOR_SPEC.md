# THE 99% GOVERNOR MANDATE

To ensure the V27 engine does not cause "Model Crystallization" or institutional shock, the system operates under a hard-coded efficiency ceiling.

- **Efficiency Cap:** 0.99
- **Resilience Buffer:** 0.01 (The 1% Slack)
- **Function:** The buffer ensures that "The Mudd" (stochastic noise) is never fully eliminated, allowing for legacy system breathing room and adaptive evolution.
